[114:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[114:1] Say: "I seek refuge with the Lord of the people, [114:2] King of
the people, [114:3] God of the people, [114:4] from the evil of the sneaking
whisperer [114:5] who whispers into the hearts of the people, [114:6] from
the Jinn and the people."
