[105:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[105:1] Have you not seen what your Lord did to the people of the elephant?
[105:2] Did He not send their plans astray? [105:3] And He set upon them
formations of birds, [105:4] striking them with fiery projectiles, [105:5]
thus He made them like devoured hay.
