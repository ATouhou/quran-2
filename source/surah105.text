[105:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[105:1] Have you not seen what your Lord did to the people of the elephant?
[105:2] Did He not cause their plans to go astray?
[105:3] And He sent upon them formations of birds in flight.
[105:4] Striking them with fiery projectiles.
[105:5] Until He turned them like devoured hay.
