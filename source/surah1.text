[1:1] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[1:2] Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.
[1:3] The Almighty, the Merciful.
[1:4] Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.
[1:5] You alone we serve, and You alone we seek for help.
[1:6] Guide us to the straight path.
[1:7] The path of those You have blessed, not of those who have incurred the wrath, nor the misguided.
