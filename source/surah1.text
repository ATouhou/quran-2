[1:1] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[1:2] Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, [1:3] the Almighty, the Merciful,
[1:4] Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. [1:5] You alone we serve, and to You
alone do we turn to for help. [1:6] Guide us to the straight path, [1:7] the
path of those who You have blessed, not that of those who have incurred the
wrath, nor the misguided.
