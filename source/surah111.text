[111:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[111:1] Condemned are the hands of the fire maker - condemned. [111:2] His
money will not avail him, nor what he has earned. [111:3] He will be sent
to a flaming fire. [111:4] And his wife who carries the logs, [111:5] on
her neck will be a rope of thorns.
