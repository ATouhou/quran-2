[113:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[113:1] Say: "I seek refuge with the Lord of the dawn,"
[113:2] "From the evil among His creation,"
[113:3] "And from the evil of murkiness as it falls,"
[113:4] "And from the evil of those who blow on knots,"
[113:5] "And from the evil of an envier when he envies."
