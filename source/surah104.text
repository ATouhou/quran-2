[104:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[104:1] Woe to every spiteful slanderer [104:2] who accumulated wealth and
piled it up. [104:3] He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal. [104:4]

the Destroyer? [104:6] The fire which God kindles, [104:7] which reaches
across the hearts? [104:8] It will enclose them [104:9] in outstretched
columns.
