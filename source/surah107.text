[107:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[107:1] Have you considered those who pretend to be religious, [107:2] while
they mistreat the orphan [107:3] and discourage feeding the poor? [107:4] Woe
unto those who pray [107:5] while ignoring their prayers, [107:6] just aiming
to be noticed, [107:7] while still they hoard wealth.
