*The Quranic Library* is an open source repo that includes:

- A modern translation of the Quran, formatted
  to make it easy to maintain and easy to parse.
- Software for parsing the source files into JSON AST files.
- Software for generating editions of the translation in various
  formats, like HTML5, EPUB and PDF.

## Status

The project is just getting started. There is plenty people can help with,
but nothing is really ready to use properly yet.

## The Project

The aim of this project is to:

- Generally improve the situation by moving everything to GitHub.
- Format the source so it is easy to automatically parse the translation.
- Make the translation available as JSON AST files. Other people can then use
  them to generate pretty webpages, apps, ebooks etc.
- Improve readability by using paragraphs and ignoring indexing in the English
  (though indexing will be retained in the source and ASTs to make it optional
  for end users).

## Translation

The Quran translation used in this project is derived from *The Message*, an
original translation that was developed by a community of Islamic reformists
based at [free-minds.org][2]. Layth Saleh al-Shaiban led the translation.
