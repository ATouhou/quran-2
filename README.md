This repo holds the source files for *The Open Quran*, an open source,
English translation of the Quran.

*The Open Quran* is one of a number of forks of the *The Message*, a
translation developed by a community of Islamic reformists based at
[free-minds.org][1], led by Layth Saleh al-Shaiban. *The Message* is
unusual, relying on the scripture alone to resolve any ambiguities,
rather than referencing the hadith literature.

For more information about the community behind the translation, visit
[free-minds.org][1] and [progressivemuslims.org][2]. You can also
purchase hardcopies of similar editions through those sites.

This fork moves everything to GitHub to improve the situation for people
who'd like to contribute and discuss the translation. The manuscript has
been converted to plain text, and is formatted so that it can be parsed
easily. The repo will also include software for parsing the source, and
for generating pretty editions in various formats.

The translation is in the public domain. The software is GPLv2.
